# Smart Hydrogel Wound Dressing  
pH-responsive hydrogel device design with COMSOL swelling and drug-release simulation.

This project demonstrates a hydrogel-based wound dressing capable of responding to 
wound pH levels. The hydrogel swells under acidic conditions and releases therapeutic
agents through diffusion. The design includes a PU protective layer, a pH-responsive
hydrogel layer, and a drug reservoir.

## COMSOL Simulation Results  

### Swelling (pH-responsive behavior)
Swelling was simulated across pH 4 → 7 → 10.  
Lower pH produces higher swelling, enabling stronger drug release.  

(Animations / GIFs will be added here)

### Drug Diffusion  
Drug concentration distribution simulated for:  
- pH 4  
- pH 7  
- pH 10  

Higher pH slows diffusion, allowing controlled release.

### Cumulative Release Curve  
The cumulative drug release curve demonstrates clear pH-dependent transport behavior.

- SolidWorks (device modeling)  
- MATLAB/Python for post-processing (optional)

## Summary  
This repository summarizes a materials-based simulation project that integrates 
hydrogel mechanics, pH-dependent swelling, and drug-release modeling into a single
device concept. It serves as a portfolio demonstration of modeling workflow,
design thinking, and visualization of material behavior.
